Types of questions:
- General questions: such questions require an answer Yes/No (e.g. "Did Mike create an issue yesterday?");
- "Listed" questions: answers for these questions are supposed to be a list (e.g. "What are the comments created by Mike?");
- Special questions: some specific information (e.g. date, location, amount etc.) is required (e.g. "When did Mike create his first issue?");
- Subject questions: questions about subjects (e.g. "Who closed issue 253?").
